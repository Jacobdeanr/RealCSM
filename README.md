shoutouts to [Blueberry_pie](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Blueberry_pie) for the original work

TODO
* [x] seperate csm from the editor into its own entity (allows menu but also keeps editor as i like being able to spawn it in) (this is sorta done so i checked the box)
* [ ] performance mode for lower end computers (2 rings only but same ring size?? idk)
* [x] research better methods for disabling sun (if possible, I doubt)
* [ ] hammer integration so map makers can specify settings for the csm
* [ ] MAKE A GODDAMN ICON FOR THE ENTITY IN THE SPAWNMENU
* [ ] Really shitty and cheap global illumination (probably very hard to do so this is unlikely)
* [ ] Shadow spread in the closest ring (maybe second ring too, yknow for insane people)
* [ ] Weapon self shadowing
* [ ] Firstperson player shadow
