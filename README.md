shoutouts to [Wouter Pleizier](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgWgnUhgP6HK8tN2Tp85jxw) for the original work

TODO
* [ ] seperate csm from the editor into its own entity (allows menu but also keeps editor as i like being able to spawn it in)
* [ ] performance mode for lower end computers (2 rings only but same ring size?? idk)
* [ ] research better methods for disabling sun (if possible, I doubt)
* [ ] hammer intergration so map makers can specify settings for the csm
* [ ] MAKE A GODDAMN ICON
